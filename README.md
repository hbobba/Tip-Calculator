# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tipping application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Harshitha Bobba**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [implemented] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [implemented] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [implemented] The tip percentage starts at a default setting of 10%. The minimum is 3% and the maximum is 30%.
- [implemented] The total amount including the tip can be divided between upto 20 people and the amount paid per person is   displayed.
